# Leetcode-Solutions
Repository Containing all personally worked and studied solutions for problems worked from Leetcode.
These solutions are sorted by easy/medium/hard files.

The process for finding these solutions involve:

  -working the solution myself without any hints
  
  -if unable to solve in some amount of time, a solution is viewed and studied to understand how and why it works step by step, as well as studying the time complexity of the solution, the underlying formula, and any unique syntax used.
  
  -after working each solution, go to the Discuss page for the problem and view how other users solved the question. Run their solutions and seek to understand why and how their solutions are faster/slower than yours, as well as why/how it required less/more memory than your solution
